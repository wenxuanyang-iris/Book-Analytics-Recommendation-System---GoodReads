st.markdown(
    """
    This is the main module for our recommendation system. You can try our system by following up 
    procedures described in pages. The main models used in our system are described as follows:
    - Recommendation models
        - Popularity model (Baseline)
        - Content-based filtering
        - Collaborative filtering
        - Ensemble model
    
    We also explored some NLP models to provide executive review of book content and reviews, 
    which can help users quickly grasp a screenshot of books recommended to them.
    
    - **Tag filtering system**: we want to extract tags for each book to enable users to filter books & comments by tags
        - Topic Modeling: LDA method
        - Keywords Extraction: TextRank
        - Keyphrases Extraction: Yake!, keyBERT, Rake, etc. 
    
    
    - **Extractive Summarization**: Extract top review sentences to serve as a summary of all reviews of each book
        - Baseline approach
        - Balanced summarization
